### The Autocorrelation Function

-   The **autocorrelation function** (**ACF**) is the main method in time series analysis for quantifying the level of correlation between a series and its lags. This method is fairly similar (both mathematically and logically) to the Pearson correlation coefficient, which we saw earlier, and can be formalized with the following expression.

![Pearson Correlation Coefficient](images/pearson%20correlation.png){width="258"}

-   The equation above represents the ACF correlation coefficient of the series with its k lag; and n, and x denote the number of observations of the series, the t observation of the series, and the mean, respectively.

```{r}
acf(USgas, lag.max = 60)
```

```{r}
acf(EURO_Brent, lag.max = 60)
```

```{r}
acf(USVSales, lag.max = 60)
```

### The Partial Autocorrelation Function

```{r}
pacf(USgas, lag.max = 60)
```

### Lag Plots

-   A lag plot is a simplistic and non-statistical approach for analyzing the relationship between a series and its lags. As the name indicates, this method is based on data visualization tools, with the use of two-dimensional scatter plots for visualizing the series (typically on the y-axis) against the k lag of the series. Hence, each pair of points represents a combination of the series observations and their corresponding lagged values. As more points on the lag plot are closer to the 45 degree line, the higher the correlation will be between the series and the corresponding lag.

```{r}
ts_lags(USgas)
```

-   Looking at the lag plots of the USgas series, you can see that, moving along from the first lag up to the sixth lag, the relationship between the series and its lags become less linear. This process starts to reverse from the seventh lag as the relationship gradually becomes more linear, where the seasonal lag (or lag 12) has the strongest relationship with the series. Those results are aligned with the ones we saw earlier with the ACF plot. By default, the ts_lags function plots the first 12 lags of the series, where the lag argument allows you to set the number of lags.

```{r}
ts_lags(USVSales)
```

```{r}
ts_lags(EURO_Brent)
```

```{r}
ts_lags(USgas, lags = c(12, 24, 36, 48))
```

## Causality Analysis (Naive Bayes)

### The Cross-correlation Function

-   The cross-correlation function (CCF) is the sister function of the ACF and it measures the level of correlation between two series and their lags in a fairly similar way. In the coming example, we will analyze the relationship between the total vehicle sales (USVSales) and the unemployment rate (USUnRate) in the US to understand whether there is a cause and effect relationship between the two. The monthly unemployment rate in the US is available in the TSstudio package, so let's load the series and review it with the ts_plot function.

```{r}
ts_info(USUnRate)
```

```{r}
ts_plot(USUnRate,
        title = "US Monthly Civllian Unemployment Rate",
        Ytitle = "Unemployment Rate (%)",
        Xgrid = TRUE,
        Ygrid = TRUE)
```

-   As you can observe in the preceding plot, the USUnRate series starts during the 1950s, as opposed to the USVSales series, which began in 1976. Therefore, before starting, let's align the two series to the same time frame using the window function:

```{r}
us_vsales <- window(USVSales, start = c(1976, 1), end = c(2018, 12))
us_unrate <- window(USVSales, start = c(1976, 1), end = c(2018, 12))
```

```{r}
head(us_vsales)
```

```{r}
us_combined <- cbind(us_vsales, us_unrate)

us_combined <- as.data.frame(us_combined)

head(us_combined)
```

```{r}
names(us_combined)
```

```{r}
plot_ly(x = time(us_vsales),
        y = us_vsales,
        type = "scatter",
        mode = "line",
        name = "Total Vehicle Sales") %>%
  add_lines(x = time(us_unrate),
            y = us_unrate,
            name = "Unemployment Rate",
            yaxis = "y2") %>%
  layout(title = "Total Monthly Vehicle Sales vs Unemployment Rate in the US",
         yaxis2 = list(overlaying = "y", side = "right", title = "Percentage", showgrid = TRUE),
         yaxis = list(title = "THousands of Units", showgrid = TRUE),
         legend = list(orientation = 'h'),
         margin = list(l = 50, r = 50, b = 50, t = 50, pad = 2))
```

```{r}
ccf(x = us_vsales, y = us_unrate, lag.max = 36)
```

```{r}
ccf_plot(x = USVSales, y = USUnRate, lags = 0:12)
```
